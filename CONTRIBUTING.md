# Contributing

We love pull requests. For new features, consider opening an issue to discuss the idea first. When you're ready to open a pull requset, here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/datadog-lambda-java.git
```

Make your change, update tests and ensure the tests pass (install Docker if you haven't):

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/your-username/datadog-lambda-java/compare/DataDog:main...main

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
